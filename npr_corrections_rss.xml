      <title>How IBM's gamble ushered in the computer age</title>
      <link>https://www.npr.org/2023/10/23/1197956188/the-indicator-watson-jr-ibm-big-gamble</link>
      <description>In a previous version of this episode, we stated that Thomas Watson Jr. fought on the side of the United States in World War II while IBM, under his father's leadership, was doing business with the Nazi regime. As a World War II pilot, Watson didn't fight in combat missions, but some of his missions did take him through combat zones where he faced enemy fire. And while IBM did sell technology to the Nazi government in the years leading up to the U.S.'s involvement in World War II, by the time the U.S. entered the war and Watson was serving in the war, the German government had seized the assets of American companies, curtailing IBM's control over its German operations.</description>
